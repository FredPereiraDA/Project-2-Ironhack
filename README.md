# Project-2-Ironhack

2nd Project: Shark Attack! Clean data form a messy csv archive and answer a business question.

Question: SHARK ATTACKS - WHERE DO THEY HAPPEN MORE AND RELATED TO WHICH ACTIVITY?

Using data cleaning process and using the matplotlib library I want to make graphics to show the results of the data cleaning done to highlight the questions above. Each graph comes with a different color and title so they don't get confused with the other ones.

Stats: Done
